Like season 1 we will have a onboarding process and guess what, we all are rookies once again.

> If you have been here for Season 1, you may be surprised to find yourself as a Rookie again. You see, it's all about innovation and hitting refresh. So, it's a fresh start for everyone. Yet we believe in excellence and that's why we need your detective skills to unveil the cr√®me de la cr√®me of detectives from the past year, 2022. This is like the ultimate leaderboard challenge where we crown the "Most Epic Detective of the Year." Exciting, right?

> Imagine our agency as a buzzing beehive, like StackOverflow on steroids. We have a crazy number of cases popping up every day, each with a juicy bounty attached (yes, cold, hard cash!). And guess what? We've got thousands of Kusto Detectives scattered across the globe, all itching to pick a case and earn their detective stripes. But here's the catch: only the first detective to crack the case gets the bounty and major street cred!

> So, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to dig into the vast archives of our system operation logs from the legendary year 2022. You're on a quest to unearth the absolute legend, the detective with the biggest impact on our business‚Äîthe one who raked in the most moolah by claiming bounties like a boss!

It's like a power-up that'll help you sharpen your Kusto-fu to tackle each case head-on. Oh, and if you stumble upon a mind-boggling case and need a little nudge, the "Hints" are there to save the day!

> Good luck, rookie, and remember to bring your sense of humor along for this wild ride!

> Lieutenant Laughter

So now we need to find the detective who earned the most money.

## Onboarding

**Welcome to season 2!**

Answer the question: Who is the detective that earned most money in 2022?

Start by logging in to your free ADX cluster, if you need to start over and create a new cluster - follow the guide here https://aka.ms/kustofree. Make sure to copy the Cluster URI (ending with kusto.windows.net) and save that somewhere or access https://dataexplorer.azure.com/freecluster to see it.

Insert the below data into your ADX cluter:

```kusto
.execute database script <|
// Create a table for the telemetry data:
.create table DetectiveCases(Timestamp:datetime, EventType:string, DetectiveId:string, CaseId: string, Properties:dynamic)
// Load the data:
.ingest async into table DetectiveCases (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2start/log_00000.csv.gz')
.ingest async into table DetectiveCases (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2start/log_00001.csv.gz')
.ingest into table DetectiveCases (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2start/log_00002.csv.gz')
```

Now we have the table **DetectiveCases** with the columns Timestamp:datetime, EventType:string, DetectiveId:string, CaseId: string, and Properties:dynamic.

![](DetectiveCases_table.png)

```kusto
DetectiveCases
| take 10
```

![](DetectiveCases_Take10.png)

In my case I didn't see any data in the Properties column. Let's dig into that.

```kusto
DetectiveCases
| where isnotempty(Properties)
| take 10
```

![](DetectiveCases_Prop.png)

Oh now we see 'Bounty' and a value. And all cases have the event 'CaseOpened'. Let's see how many EventTypes we have.

```kusto
DetectiveCases
| summarize count() by EventType
```

![](DetectiveCases_Events.png)

Let's try to extract the Bounty value from the Properties column with:

```kusto
DetectiveCases
| extend Bounty = toreal(Properties.Bounty)
| where isnotempty( Bounty )
| project Timestamp, EventType, DetectiveId, CaseId, Bounty
```

Now that we have extracted that value we can add a new line with summarize sum() to get the total bounty.

```kusto
DetectiveCases
| extend Bounty = toreal(Properties.Bounty)
| where isnotempty(Bounty)
| project Timestamp, EventType, DetectiveId, CaseId, Bounty
| summarize TotalBounty = sum(Bounty)
```

If we go deeper into a case and how that case will be assigned to different detectives, we do see that multiple detectives can solve one case.

```kusto
DetectiveCases
| where CaseId == "CASE_1116553"
```

![](DetectiveCases_Case.png)

I do believe we need to join this with "CaseSolved" event and take the first detected that solved that case and the arg_min() function with the Timestamp column will help us with that.

**My solution:**

```kusto
DetectiveCases
| extend Bounty = toreal(Properties.Bounty)
| project CaseId, DetectiveId, Bounty
| join kind=inner (
DetectiveCases
| where EventType == "CaseSolved"
| summarize arg_min(Timestamp, DetectiveId) by CaseId
| project-rename FirstDetective=DetectiveId
) on CaseId
| summarize TotalBountyToDetective=sum(Bounty) by FirstDetective
| top 1 by TotalBountyToDetective desc
```


## Case 1

**To bill or not to bill?**

<img src="https://detective.kusto.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkda-webassets.azureedge.net%2Fimages%2Fs2_case_001_5262aa40.png&w=750&q=75" width=35% height=35%>

Answer the question - What is the total bills amount due in April?

The Kusto Detective Agency welcomes you to investigate a mystery in Digitown where water and electricity bills have doubled without explanation. Equipped with telemetry data and an SQL query, you must use your skills to uncover hidden errors and solve the perplexing situation before the upcoming mayoral election.

Ingest the below data into your free cluster:

```kusto
.execute database script <|
// The script takes ~20seconds to complete ingesting all the data.
.set-or-replace Costs <| 
    datatable(MeterType:string, Unit:string, Cost:double) [
     'Water', 'Liter', 0.001562, 
     'Electricity', 'kwH', 0.3016]
.create-merge table Consumption (Timestamp:datetime , HouseholdId:string, MeterType:string, Consumed:double)
.ingest async into table Consumption (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2c1taxbills/log_00000.csv.gz')
.ingest async into table Consumption (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2c1taxbills/log_00001.csv.gz')
.ingest into table Consumption (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2c1taxbills/log_00002.csv.gz')
```

Here's the SQL query used for the calculation.

```sql
SELECT SUM(Consumed * Cost) AS TotalCost
FROM Costs
JOIN Consumption ON Costs.MeterType = Consumption.MeterType
```


## Case 2

**Catch the Phishermen**

```kusto
.execute database script <|
.create-merge table PhoneCalls (Timestamp:datetime, EventType:string, CallConnectionId:string, Properties:dynamic)
.ingest async into table PhoneCalls (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2c2phonecalls/log_00000.csv.gz')
.ingest async into table PhoneCalls (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2c2phonecalls/log_00001.csv.gz')
// Last command is running sync, so when it finishes the data is already ingested.
// It can take about 1min to run.
.ingest into table PhoneCalls (@'https://kustodetectiveagency.blob.core.windows.net/kda2c2phonecalls/log_00002.csv.gz')
```

```kusto
PhoneCalls
| take 10
```

```kusto
PhoneCalls
| summarize count() by bin(Timestamp,1h)
```

```kusto
PhoneCalls
| take 10
| extend Origin = tostring(Properties.Origin)
| extend Destination = tostring(Properties.Destination)
| extend IsHidden = tobool(Properties.IsHidden)
| extend DisconnectedBy = tostring(Properties.DisconnectedBy)
| project-reorder Timestamp,CallConnectionId,EventType,Origin,Destination,IsHidden,DisconnectedBy
```
